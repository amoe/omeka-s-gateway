# omeka-s-gateway

This is a thin wrapper for the Omeka-S REST API.  It's rather
unprincipled/pragmatic depending on how complimentary you would like to be.  It
was developed as part of the Queer Heritage South digital archive project.

This is far from industrial strength, please do not rely on it.
